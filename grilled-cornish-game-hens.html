    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        These grilled game hens were a wonderful diversion from our usual, more mundane (i.e. chicken) menu.
        I confess that I only had two hens for the 4 servings I was hoping for. Prior to marinading, I cut
        each of them in half lengthwise, so that each half had a wing and a drumstick. I placed the four halves
        in a glass baking dish and poured on the marinade. (I made 1/2 the marinade, since I had half the game hens!).
        My husband, who is the Grill Master, popped them on the grill and cooked them slowly as he would a large, bone-in chicken breast.
